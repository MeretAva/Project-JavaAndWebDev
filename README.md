# Project-JavaAndWebDev
For the course Project: Java and Web Development, I created a website called ThreeHorsesQuiz that prompts the user with a quiz about my three horses.

_All the information on the website is from my own representation._

**Installation and Run instructions:**
To install the website, clone the GitHub repository to your local working directory. Do this by either using HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and the git clone command in your terminal.
Then run the web application by opening the index.html file.
